App Description: 
    Allow users to create an account, sign in to their account, view a dashboard of the current weather in their area, and sign out of their account. Uses cookies to keep track of a user's session and if they're already logged in. Users can also reset their password if they forgot it.
    Eventually the idea is that users would be able to connect their smart wearable device (Whoop, Oura Ring, Garmin Watch, Apple Watch, FitBit, etc.)
    and data visualizations would appear on their dashboard along with their daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals to keep them on track.
